# GuardMobs
GuardMobs! The long awaited plugin that I made in less than a week. Buggy? Messy? Somewhat unstable? Of course it is! *I* wrote it after all.

Currently not public as I don't believe I am allowed to share unobfuscated minecraft source code, and it's used quite a bit throughout. Why am I writing this
README? Fuck if I know! 

The only configurable thing about this plugin is the prices it costs to upgrade each entity to each level, from 1 to 5. I don't plan on making Guard Mob damage
configurable because that would seriously screw with the scaling between levels. Or rather, it would make making them configurable while keeping any semblance
of scaling between levels a real pain in the ass. Making prices configurable was already enough of a pain in the ass. However, if I did decide to make 
Guard Mob damage configuable, it will be slightly easier since I can repurpose the price configuration process to instead handle everything configurable. 
At this point though, I'm just going to balance the Guard Mobs as I see fit.
