# GuardMobs
GuardMobs! The long awaited plugin that I rushed to make in less than a week. Buggy? Messy? Somewhat unstable? Of course it is! *I* wrote it after all.

In all seriousness, I will be engaging in cleaning and optimizing as soon as every functional thing is satisfactory, at least by my standards. I'm still working
out the kinks with the Saint and I have yet to make everything configurable, so I have quite a bit to do still. Currently, every GuardMob, save for *maybe* 
Archer and Swordsman, is as unbalanced as it can be, especially at tier 5. There's also the matter of making them controllable in-game. At the moment, all 
GuardMobs will move back to the position in which they spawned, though I plan to make it so they can follow a player when something is toggled.
